### 🩺 Epidemiology & Surveillance Expertise  
With over 10 years of experience, I’ve worked extensively in **disease surveillance**, **vaccination analytics**, and **public health intelligence**.  

In my current role at the **Western Australian Department of Health**, I:  
- Lead **communicable disease and immunisation surveillance**, analysing data from the **Western Australian Notifiable Infectious Diseases Database (WANIDD)** and the **Australian Immunisation Register (AIR)**.  
- Design and maintain **REDCap databases** for notifiable disease surveillance and case management.  
- Automate workflows for data extraction, cleaning, and reporting using **R** and **SQL**, ensuring timely and reproducible outputs.  
- Develop advanced visualisations — spatial maps, heatmaps, dashboards — to support rapid outbreak response and immunisation performance monitoring.  

Previously, as a **Research Fellow** at the *University of Queensland*, I led **cancer epidemiology** research focusing on diagnosis, treatment, and survival among **First Nations Peoples**, and managed the **Australian Cancer Atlas** project to visualise national cancer disparities.

### 🧠 My Approach  
I believe impactful epidemiology is grounded in:  
1. **Scientific rigour** – producing transparent and reproducible analysis.  
2. **Collaboration** – engaging clinicians, Aboriginal health organisations, and policymakers to ensure data informs real change.  
3. **Actionable insight** – turning surveillance data into evidence that strengthens public health programs and equity.
