# **Overview of Presentation Contents**

This presentation introduces essential techniques for analyzing date and time data in health research using R. Key topics include:

-   **Importance of date/time analysis**

-   **Core R packages** for handling dates (e.g., `lubridate`, `tidyverse`)

-   **Date conversion and formatting**

-   **Calculating durations and age**

-   **Extracting date components** (e.g., month, weekday, season)

-   **Summary and Visualize time-based trends**

**1. Importance of Date/Time Analysis in Health Data**

Date-time data is crucial in healthcare because it allows us to:

-   Calculate accurate patient ages, service time

-   Measure time intervals between critical events (e.g., diagnosis to treatment, age vaccination)

-   Identify seasonal patterns in disease occurrence

-   Track vaccine effectiveness over time

-   Determine follow-up periods for clinical studies

```{r, echo=TRUE}
setwd("C:/Users/User/Desktop/Materials_ Course and proposals/Course Related/DataCamp/Data/Synthetic_data")

patients <- read.csv("patients.csv")
vaccination <- read.csv("immunizations.csv")

```

```{r}
# Convert column names to lowercase
colnames(patients) <- tolower(colnames(patients))
colnames(vaccination) <- tolower(colnames(vaccination))

# View data
# head(patients)
# head(vaccination)

str(patients)
str(vaccination)

# Check for missing IDs
patients$id[patients$id == ""] <- NA
print(sum(is.na(patients$id)))

# Check duplicates
patients <- patients %>%
  arrange(id) %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  mutate(dup = row_number()) %>%
  ungroup()

table(patients$dup)  # Check if any duplicates exist

```

```{r,echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
# Merge with vaccination data
vaccination <- vaccination %>% mutate(id = patient)


vacc_pt_merged <- left_join(patients, vaccination, by = "id" )

#vacc_pt_merged <- left_join(patients, vaccination, by = c("id" = "patient"))

str (vacc_pt_merged)
```

# Converting Character to Date Format

in the dataset `birthdate`, `deathdate`, and `date` (vaccination date) are all stored as character strings. I need to convert these to proper date formats using `lubridate::ymd()`.

```{r}
# Convert to date format
str (vacc_pt_merged$birthdate)
str (vacc_pt_merged$date) # date is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.

vacc_pt_merged <- vacc_pt_merged %>%
  mutate(
    birthdate = parse_date(birthdate, format = "%Y-%m-%d"),
    vacc_date = as.Date(strptime(date, format = "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"))
  )

# Check structure
str (vacc_pt_merged$birthdate)
str (vacc_pt_merged$vacc_date)

# Check converted formats via glimpse
# glimpse(vacc_pt_merged)

# no missing values on dates
sum(is.na(vacc_pt_merged$birthdate)) 
sum(is.na(vacc_pt_merged$vacc_date))

# Check date ranges
summary(vacc_pt_merged$birthdate)
summary(vacc_pt_merged$vacc_date)
 
```

Now date columns are in Date format (`YYYY-MM-DD`), ready for analysis!

# **Age and Service year Calculation**

Age at the time of vaccination is essential. Here’s how I calculate it in **years**.

```{r}
vacc_pt_merged <- vacc_pt_merged %>%
  mutate(
    age_years = floor (as.numeric(difftime(Sys.Date(), birthdate, units = "days")) / 365.25),
    
    # Calculate vaccination service year by extracting the year from vacc_date
   vacc_service_year = year(vacc_date)
  )


summary(vacc_pt_merged$age_years)
summary(vacc_pt_merged$vacc_service_year)

# tabulation
table(vacc_pt_merged$age_years)
table(vacc_pt_merged$vacc_service_year)

```

As shown above, the **average age at vaccination** was approximately `r round(mean(vacc_pt_merged$age_years, na.rm = TRUE), 1)` years, with a range from `r min(vacc_pt_merged$age_years, na.rm = TRUE)` to `r max(vacc_pt_merged$age_years, na.rm = TRUE)` years.

The **highest frequency of vaccinations** occurred in the year `r names(which.max(table(vacc_pt_merged$vacc_service_year)))`, suggesting a peak in service delivery during that period.

# **Calculating Time Differences**

To calculate time differences, I use `interval()` or simple subtraction between date objects.

Example: Years between birth and vaccination gives the **number of years from birth to vaccination**.

```{r}

vacc_pt_merged <- vacc_pt_merged %>%
  mutate(
    days_to_vax = as.numeric(vacc_date - birthdate),  # Difference in days
    weeks_to_vax = as.numeric(difftime(vacc_date,  birthdate,  units = "weeks")),  # Difference in weeks
    months_to_vax = as.numeric(difftime(vacc_date,  birthdate,  units = "days")) / 30.44,  # Approximate months (average days per month)
    years_to_vax = floor(as.numeric(difftime(vacc_date,  birthdate,  units = "days")) / 365.25)  # Approximate years (including leap years)
  )


# View summary statistics 
summary(vacc_pt_merged$days_to_vax)
summary(vacc_pt_merged$weeks_to_vax)
summary(vacc_pt_merged$months_to_vax)
summary(vacc_pt_merged$years_to_vax)


```

# **Extracting Date Components**

We will perform the following extractions for both the `birthdate` and `vaccination date`:

1.  **Day**: The day of the month is extracted using the `day()` function.

2.  **Month**: The month of the date is obtained with the `month()` function. This provides a numeric value (1 for January, 12 for December).

3.  **Year**: The year component is retrieved using the `year()` function, returning a four-digit value for the year.

4.  **Quarter**: The quarter of the year is extracted using the `quarter()` function, providing a numeric value from 1 to 4, representing the first through fourth quarter of the year.

5.  **Season**: Based on the month, we assign a corresponding season (Summer, Autumn, Winter, or Spring) using a conditional `case_when()` function:

These components are useful for segmenting the data, performing seasonal analysis, and understanding how different periods influence the patterns observed in the data. For instance, analyzing vaccination trends by quarter or season can provide valuable insights into public health strategies.

By extracting these components, we are preparing the data for more granular analysis, including cohort analysis, seasonal trend assessments, and other forms of time-based grouping.

```{r}
vacc_pt_merged <- vacc_pt_merged %>%
  mutate(
    # Basic date components
    vacc_day = day(vacc_date),
    vacc_month = month(vacc_date),
    vacc_month_name = month(vacc_date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE),  # Full month name
    vacc_year = year(vacc_date),
    vacc_weekday = wday(vacc_date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE),     # Full weekday name
    vacc_week = week(vacc_date),                                    # Week of year
    vacc_quarter = quarter(vacc_date),
    
    # Fiscal year (assuming June start)
    vacc_fy = ifelse(vacc_month >= 6, vacc_year, vacc_year - 1),
    
    # Season (Northern Hemisphere)
    vacc_season = case_when(
      vacc_month %in% 3:5 ~ "Spring",
      vacc_month %in% 6:8 ~ "Summer",
      vacc_month %in% 9:11 ~ "Autumn",
      TRUE ~ "Winter"  # December-February
    ),
    
    # Weekend flag
    is_weekend = wday(vacc_date) %in% c(1, 7),  # 1=Sunday, 7=Saturday
    
    # Days since specific reference date (e.g., pandemic start)
    days_since_ref = floor(as.numeric(vacc_date - as.Date("2020-01-01")))
  )
```

# Filtering Between Date Ranges

Filtering data based on specific date ranges is a common operation in data analysis, particularly when focusing on subsets of data that fall within particular periods. In R, the `dplyr` package provides an intuitive way to filter rows within a specific date range.

Below is an example of how to filter rows based on dates that fall between two specified dates using the `filter()` function:

```{r}
# Filter only vaccinations in 2022
vacc_2022 <- vacc_pt_merged %>%
  filter(vacc_date >= ymd("2022-01-01") & vacc_date <= ymd("2022-12-31"))

# Filter vaccinations between 2015 and 2024
vacc_1524 <- vacc_pt_merged %>%
  filter(vacc_service_year >= 2015 & vacc_service_year <= 2024)
         

table(vacc_1524$vacc_year)

table(vacc_1524$race)

# table(vacc_1524$ethnicity)

```

```{r}
# ordering variables for visual checking 
vacc_1524 <- vacc_1524 %>% 
  select(id, gender, race, birthdate, date, vacc_date, age_years, vacc_service_year, days_to_vax, weeks_to_vax, 
         months_to_vax, years_to_vax, vacc_day, vacc_month, vacc_month_name, vacc_year, vacc_weekday, vacc_week, 
         vacc_quarter, vacc_fy, vacc_season, is_weekend, days_since_ref, everything())

```

📝 **Summary of Vaccination Uptake by Gender and Time Period**

The table Aabove presents vaccination counts and gender proportions across different time units—**year, quarter, and weekday**—for individuals aged 15–24 years.

#### **By Year**

-   **2021** recorded the **highest vaccination uptake** for both **females (146; 18.3%)** and **males (117; 15.5%)**, indicating a peak in vaccine distribution during that year.

-   The **lowest uptake** was observed in **2017 for females (65; 8.1%)** and in **2016 for males (62; 8.2%)**.

    Overall, vaccination was more evenly distributed across years, but there was a noticeable increase in 2021, likely due to public health initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic.

    #### **By Quarter**

-   For **females**, the highest uptake was in **Quarter 2 (230; 28.8%)**, followed by **Quarter 3 (205; 25.7%)**.

-   For **males**, **Quarter 3 (262; 34.7%)** had the highest uptake, while **Quarter 2 (146; 19.3%)** was lower in comparison.

    **Quarter 1** showed the **lowest female uptake proportionally (21.8%)**, while **Quarter 4** had the lowest for males (15.6%).

#### **By Weekday**

-   **Wednesday (157; 20.8%)** was the peak for males.

-   **Friday (14.7%)** and **Thursday (17.9%)** were more popular among males.

-   **Monday had the lowest male uptake (7.9%)**, while **Tuesday (9.9%)** was the lowest for females.

# 📊 Visualizing Vaccination Trends

Time-based visualizations help us uncover trends, seasonality, and variation in vaccination data. Below are some examples of how to visualize date information using the `vacc_pt_merged` dataset. These plots support evidence-based insights and can guide public health decision-making.

#### **Overall Vaccination Patterns by by Gender and Race**

-   **2021** was a notable year across most racial groups, with **peaks in vaccination uptake**, likely due to intensified COVID-19 vaccine rollouts.

-   The **“Other” racial group** showed the **most fluctuation** with a sharp spike in 2023.

-   The **White group** had the **most consistent trend**, while **Asian and Black groups** showed spikes at specific periods.

-   **Females showed a sharper peak** than males in 2021 but also had a **steeper decline afterward**.

-   **Males had more consistent trends overall**, especially from 2015–2020 and 2022–2024.

-   The **post-2021 decline** in both groups may suggest reduced urgency or campaign intensity in recent years

-   Post-2021, a general **decline across all groups** suggests possible vaccine fatigue or the end of mass campaign periods.

-   Variations of vaccination uptake by gender and race are evident, suggesting differing levels of access, trust, or outreach effectiveness across communities.

### Monthly Vaccination Trend in each Year

Use a line plot to visualize how the number of vaccinations changes over time.

The time series reveals longitudinal patterns, showing potential campaign effects (peaks) or service interruptions (troughs). The upward trend in mid 2021 suggests successful program for vaccination.

As shown in the monthly vaccination pattern,

-   A **bi-modal pattern** is evident with two peaks (March and August) and two noticeable dips (June and November).

-   **March and August** are peak months — possibly due to public health campaigns.

-   **November** was the lowest — possibly due to holiday distractions, reduced outreach, or end-of-year slowdowns.
