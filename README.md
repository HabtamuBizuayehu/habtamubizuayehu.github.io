### *Epidemiologist | Data Analyst | Public Health Researcher*  

👋 **Welcome to my website and professional portfolio.**  
I’m an Epidemiologist and Data Analyst with over a decade of experience across government, academia, and international health projects.  
My mission is to apply epidemiological principles and data-driven insights to strengthen disease surveillance systems, support outbreak investigation, and enhance evidence-based public health action.

### 🩺 Epidemiology, Surveillance & Outbreak Response  
I have led and contributed to multiple public health intelligence projects in **infectious disease surveillance**, **vaccine-preventable disease monitoring**, and **health data analysis**.  

In my current role at the **Western Australian Department of Health**, I:  
- Lead **disease surveillance** and **outbreak investigations**, analysing case data from the **Western Australian Notifiable Infectious Diseases Database (WANIDD)** and the **Australian Immunisation Register (AIR)**.  
- Support **immunisation performance reviews**, detect emerging trends, and provide epidemiological reports for public health programs.  
- Design and maintain **REDCap databases** to improve case management, monitoring, and reporting of notifiable diseases.  
- Develop automated R-based workflows for **data extraction**, **cleaning**, and **visualisation**, ensuring real-time data availability.  
- Produce **weekly and ad-hoc surveillance reports**, **heatmaps**, **spatial clusters**, and **dashboards** to support rapid response and health communication.  

Previously, as a **Research Fellow** at the *University of Queensland*, I led research in **cancer epidemiology**, focusing on diagnosis, treatment, and survival among **First Nations Peoples**.
Previously, I managed the **Australian Cancer Atlas**, led a cancer equity project as principal investigator, and contributed to the First Nations Advisory Group, informing culturally safe strategies for cancer prevention and control.

### 🧠 My Approach  
My work combines **epidemiological expertise** and **data science precision** to inform practical, evidence-based decisions.  

I believe impactful epidemiology is grounded in:  
1. **Scientific rigour** – using reproducible, transparent analytical methods.  
2. **Timely surveillance** – detecting, investigating, and communicating outbreaks effectively.  
3. **Collaborative engagement** – working with clinicians, Aboriginal health organisations, and policymakers to ensure data drives meaningful health improvement.
