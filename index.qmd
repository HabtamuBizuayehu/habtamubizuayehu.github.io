# **Data Analyst \| Epidemiologist \| Researcher**

# 👋 Hello! Welcome to my website.

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
I’m *Epidemiologist*, *Data Analyst*, and *Public Health Expert* with over a decade of experience in data analysis, research, and teaching. I have diverse experience across government health departments, academic institutions, and international projects.

Here, I’ll be sharing my experiences, insights, and practical tips across topics like **epidemiology**, **data science**, **statistical analysis**, and **public health research**. Expect blog posts, tutorials, and code snippets—from automating reports in R to visualising health outcomes with Power BI and Shiny.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I build automated workflows, produce weekly, quarterly, and ad hoc reports, and create engaging visualisations such as dashboards, spatial maps, and heatmaps that inform timely public health action. I have authored over 40 peer-reviewed journal articles, more than two major reports, and a book chapter. I’ve also taught Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Public Health courses, supervised junior staff and research students, and delivered training in R, REDCap, and data visualisation.

I believe in the power of **inclusive collaboration, technical rigour, and actionable insight**. I work closely with clinical teams, Aboriginal health organisations, and policy-makers to ensure data is not just collected—but used meaningfully to improve lives.
