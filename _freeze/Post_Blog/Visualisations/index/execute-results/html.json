It compresses complex data into **interpretable evidence**—accelerating surveillance, highlighting disparities, and informing resource allocation and policy. \n\nThis guide focuses on **practical, reproducible patterns** for turning tidy data into clear visuals. We emphasise:\\\n- **Interpretability:** factor ordering with `forcats`, readable axes and labels with `scales`, and minimal, consistent theming.\\\n- **Equity lenses:** stratifying by key subgroups (e.g., age, educational status, remoteness) to make disparities visible.\\\n- **Transparency:** plots that make assumptions, denominators, and uncertainty explicit.\n\n**Why visualisation matters in public health**\n\n-   **Timely decisions:** concise visuals support rapid decisions during outbreaks, immunisation drives, and service planning.\\\n-   **Equity & accountability:** disaggregated displays can reveal gaps that averages hide, prompting targeted action.\\\n-   **Reproducibility:** code-driven charts ensure the same inputs produce the same outputs—essential for audit and publication.\n\n## **What you will learn**\n\n-   Robust patterns for **comparisons**, **time trends**, **small multiples**, and **annotated rate displays**.\\\n-   How to control category order and groupings with `forcats`, and apply human-friendly scales with `scales`.\\\n-   Lightweight theming for **publication-ready** figures that prioritise the message over the styling.\\\n\n**This Presentation/Project Covers**\n\n\\- **DATA VISUALIZATION WITH `ggplot2`**\\\nChart components, common plots, multivariate visuals, geospatial maps, overlays, themes and labels.\n\n\\- **SHINY APP – BUILDING WEB APPS**\\\nUI and server structure, reactive inputs/outputs, DT tables, app deployment.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Visualization Contents and Types Overview**\n\n-   **Layers**: Theme, Coordinates, Facets, Statistics, Geometries, Aesthetics, Data\n-   **Chart Types**: line, histogram, boxplot, bar, area, density, violin, dotplot, ECDF, scatter, bubble, QQ plot\n-   **Comparative & Multivariate**: faceted plot, pair plot, heatmap, treemap, radar chart, ridgeline plot, forest plot\n-   **Geospatial Visualization**: choropleth map, point map, heatmap overlay\n-   **Statistical Overlays**: error bars, confidence intervals, regression lines, smoothers\n-   **Interactive Visualization**: scatter/line/bar (Plotly), interactive tables (DT), interactive maps (Leaflet), dashboards (Shiny, flexdashboard)\n\nEffective visualizations help uncover patterns, trends, and insights in data. In R, we commonly use the `ggplot2` package for static plots and tools like `plotly`, `DT`, and `leaflet` for interactive dashboards and graphics.\n\nThe sections below summarize different types of visualizations and how they fit into analysis workflows.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## **🔹 Visualization Layer Components**\n\nEvery ggplot chart is built using multiple composable layers: - **Data**: The dataset to visualize. - **Aesthetics (`aes()`)**: Mappings between variables and visual elements (e.g., x, y, color). - **Geometries (`geom_*`)**: Plot types (e.g., `geom_line()`, `geom_bar()`). - **Statistics (`stat_*`)**: Summaries or transformations (e.g., `stat_smooth()`). - **Facets**: Create multiple plots by group (`facet_wrap()`, `facet_grid()`). - **Coordinates**: Set axis and aspect ratio (`coord_cartesian()`, `coord_flip()`). - **Themes**: Control overall appearance (e.g., `theme_minimal()`, `theme_bw()`).\n\n### **🔹 Common Chart Types**\n\n| **Chart Type** | **Function** | **Used For** |\n|----|----|----|\n| Line Chart | `geom_line()` | Trends over time |\n| Histogram | `geom_histogram()` | Distribution of continuous variables |\n| Boxplot | `geom_boxplot()` | Distribution & outliers |\n| Bar Plot | `geom_bar()` | Counts or categorical comparison |\n| Area Plot | `geom_area()` | Cumulative trends |\n| Density Plot | `geom_density()` | Smoothed distribution |\n| Violin Plot | `geom_violin()` | Combination of boxplot + density |\n| Dot Plot | `geom_dotplot()` | Count-based plots |\n| ECDF Plot | `stat_ecdf()` | Cumulative distribution |\n| Scatter Plot | `geom_point()` | Bivariate relationships |\n| Bubble Plot | `geom_point(aes(size = ...))` | 3-variable comparison using size |\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **🔹 Comparative & Multivariate Visuals**\n\n| **Visual Type** | **Purpose** |\n|----|----|\n| **Faceted Plot** (`facet_wrap`) | Compare subgroups in separate panels |\n| **Pair Plot** (`GGally::ggpairs`) | Explore all pairwise relationships |\n| **Heatmap** (`geom_tile`, `heatmap()`) | Show intensity using color |\n| **Treemap** (`treemapify`) | Hierarchical categories and values |\n| **Radar Chart** (`fmsb`) | Compare multivariate profiles |\n| **Ridgeline Plot** (`ggridges`) | Distribution comparison across groups |\n| **Forest Plot** (`forestplot`, `ggforestplot`) | Confidence intervals and effect sizes |\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **🔹 Geospatial Visualizations**\n\n| **Map Type** | **Function/Use** |\n|----|----|\n| Choropleth Map | Show values by region (e.g., `geom_sf()`, `tmap`) |\n| Point Map | Locations with coordinates (e.g., `geom_point()`, `leaflet::addMarkers`) |\n| Heatmap Overlay | Density of spatial events (e.g., `leaflet::addHeatmap()`) |\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **🔹 Statistical Enhancements (Overlays)**\n\n-   **Error bars**: `geom_errorbar()` for confidence or SD intervals\n-   **Regression lines**: `geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")`\n-   **Trend smoothing**: `geom_smooth()` with `method = \"loess\"`\n-   **Labeling**: `geom_text()`, `geom_label()` to annotate plots\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis section demonstrates how to visualize breast cancer screening and vaccination data. We'll walk through common chart types such as line plots, bar charts, boxplots, and faceted views.

The distribution highlights a clear **bimodal pattern**, indicating two main age groups. The largest group comprises younger adults, predominantly around 20–30 years old, suggesting a significant representation of young adults. A smaller secondary group emerges around 55–65 years old, reflecting a noticeable segment of older adults. This pattern may indicate specific target groups or demographic characteristics relevant to the population from which the data was collected. Understanding these age clusters can help tailor appropriate health strategies, services, or interventions accordingly.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvacc_1524 %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 5, fill = \"darkblue\", color = \"white\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_density(color = \"red\", size = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Age Distribution with Density Curve\", x = \"Age\", y = \"Density\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: The dot-dot notation (`..density..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(density)` instead.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Pie Chart – Proportion by Vaccine Group**\\\nShows how vaccine groups are proportionally represented in the dataset.

Some individuals beyond this age range appear as outliers, suggesting occasional vaccinations in older groups.\n\n-   **Respiratory vaccines** generally target an older age group, with the median age around 50 years, and a broad range from younger adults to elderly populations.\n\n-   The **Other vaccines** category has a wider age distribution overall, suggesting these vaccines serve diverse age groups, though with fewer individuals compared to the other two groups.\n\n**Implications:**\n\nThis visualization highlights clear age-based targeting for different vaccine categories. Childhood vaccines are expectedly administered primarily to younger populations, while respiratory vaccines predominantly reach older adults.

The violin shape is widest near the lower ages, tapering quickly, which indicates that childhood vaccines are rarely given to older individuals.\n\n-   **Respiratory vaccines**:\\\n    The distribution leans toward older age groups, with the median age higher than in other categories. The violin is widest in the 40–70 age range, suggesting respiratory vaccines are more commonly administered to older adults.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **Other vaccines**:\\\n    This group shows a broader age range. The shape suggests two areas of concentration: one among younger children and another around age 60–70, indicating this group includes vaccine types used across diverse age groups.\n\n    **Overall**, this combined plot provides both statistical summaries (via boxplot) and full distribution shapes (via violin plot), helping to clearly distinguish the age-related usage patterns across vaccine types.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvacc_1524 %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = vacc_group3, y = age, fill = vacc_group3)) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.4, color = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, outlier.shape = NA) +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot with Violin Overlay\", x = NULL, y = \"Age\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Notched Boxplot – Median Comparison**\\\nNotches allow a rough comparison of medians across groups.

It provides a structured approach to turning R scripts into accessible apps for broader audiences.\n\nA typical Shiny app includes two core components:\n\n-   **UI (User Interface)**: Defines layout, inputs, and outputs shown on the screen interface.\n-   **Server**: Contains the logic that processes data and responds to user interactions.\n\nShiny apps can include multiple views (tabs), export buttons, dynamic filtering, charts, and customized design themes.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **🔹 UI Layout and Page Structure**\n\n-   `fluidPage()`: Defines the page layout.\n-   `sidebarLayout()`, `sidebarPanel()`, `mainPanel()`: Organize inputs and outputs side-by-side.\n-   `tabsetPanel()`: Allows tab navigation for multi-page apps.\n-   `tags$style()`, `shinythemes::shinytheme()`: Add or apply custom styles/themes.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **🔹 Server Logic and Reactivity**\n\n-   `reactive()`: Creates reactive data or expressions.\n-   `observeEvent()`: Executes code when a trigger changes.\n-   `req()`: Validates necessary input before proceeding.\n-   Output functions: `renderPlotly()`, `renderDT()`, `renderText()`, `renderTable()`.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **🔹 Inputs and Outputs**\n\n| **Type** | **Function** | **Purpose** |\n|----|----|----|\n| Input | `sliderInput()` | Select a numeric value or range |\n| Input | `selectInput()` | Dropdown menu to choose a category |\n| Input | `colourInput()` | Select a color |\n| Input | `actionButton()` | Trigger processing on click |\n| Input | `downloadButton()` | Download output tables or data |\n| Output | `plotlyOutput()` | Render interactive plots using Plotly |\n| Output | `DTOutput()`, `datatable()` | Render interactive tables |\n| Output | `formatStyle()` | Apply styling (e.g., color, font) to tables |\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **🔹 Table Export Options (DT Extension)**\n\n-   Add `extensions = 'Buttons'` to enable table exports.\n-   Export types: `\"copy\"`, `\"csv\"`, `\"excel\"`, `\"pdf\"`, `\"print\"`.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **🔹 Launching the App**\n\n-   `shinyApp(ui, server)`: Runs the Shiny app combining both UI and server logic.\n-   Apps can be hosted on ShinyApps.io, internal servers, or embedded in R Markdown dashboards.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Shiny app code below demonstrates how interactive visualizations can be built using R to present health data in an accessible and user-friendly format. Specifically, it explores breast cancer screening uptake across states, years, and age groups in Australia. The app enhances user engagement through customizable features and immediate feedback mechanisms.\n\nKey capabilities demonstrated include: - Dynamic UI generation using `fluidPage()`, `sidebarLayout()`, and interactive widgets - State selection using a dropdown (`selectInput()`), which scales better than radio buttons - Age group filtering with a multiple selection input - Quantile-based filtering with `sliderInput()` for rate grouping - Color customization of output using `colourInput()` for personalizing table aesthetics - A modal popup (`modalDialog()`) triggered by a help button to explain data sources - Export options via `downloadButton()` and `DT` export buttons for multiple file formats - Real-time data filtering using `reactive()` expressions to tailor output to user input - An interactive line plot rendered via `plotly` and `ggplot2` for visualization - Fully styled, downloadable data table with `DT::renderDT()` and export capabilities\n\nSee the live app at the following platforms\n\n-   **AnalyticsHub YouTube**: <https://studio.youtube.com/video/5V7SPBH-8BE/edit>\n-   **Live App**: <https://j9eu4e-habtamu-mellie0bizuayehu.shinyapps.io/Breast_Cancer_Screening_Shiny_App/>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Install required packages if not already installed\nrequired_packages <- c(\"shiny\", \"ggplot2\", \"plotly\", \"DT\", \"dplyr\", \"shinyjs\", \"shinyWidgets\", \"scales\", \"colourpicker\")\n\n# Install missing ones\nnew_packages <- required_packages[!(required_packages %in% installed.packages()[,\"Package\"])]\nif(length(new_packages)) install.packages(new_packages)\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(DT)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(shinyjs)\nlibrary(shinyWidgets)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(colourpicker)\n\n\n# load the data\nload(\"C:/Users/User/Desktop/Materials_ Course and proposals/VIP collection for Syntax code or project titles/R codes/Shiny App BC Screening/Breast Cancer Screening.RData\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# -------------------Shiny Application for Breast Cancer Screening---------------------\n\n\n# ------------------- UI and Server Definition ---------------------\n\n# Define custom CSS for styling buttons and other UI elements\nui <- fluidPage(\n  \n  #

When designed with intent, figures surface trends, quantify disparities, and support timely, transparent decisions.\n\nThis project addressed the core contents of data visualisation: the ggplot2 layering system (Data, Aesthetics, Geometries, Statistics, Facets, Coordinates, Theme) and a taxonomy of chart types (distribution, comparison, relationship, time). It also covered multivariate displays (facets, heatmaps, treemaps, ridgelines, forest plots), statistical overlays (error bars, CIs, regressions, smoothers), and interactive components via Plotly, DT, Leaflet, and Shiny.\n\n**Key practices**\n\n-   **Interpretability first:** order factors deliberately, label axes in human terms, and annotate denominators and assumptions.\n-   **Equity by default:** disaggregate and compare across meaningful subgroups *(e.g., age, educational status, remoteness)* to reveal gaps hidden by averages.\n-   **Reproducibility & audit:** script plots, version inputs, and keep footnotes/metadata with each figure.\n-   **Accessibility:** use colour-blind-safe palettes, plain-language titles, and adequate contrast.\n\n**Safeguards**\n\n-   Manage **small numbers** (suppress/aggregate) and show **uncertainty** where relevant.\n-   Preserve comparability over time by documenting **definition changes**, **population shifts**, and **data revisions**.\n-   Triangulate sensitive findings before dissemination.\n\n**Operational next steps**\n\n-   Adopt shared templates (themes, scales, captions) and a reproducible pipeline (automated renders, QA checks).\n-   Pair every figure with a one-sentence takeaway and a link to methods so stakeholders can act quickly.\n\nVisualisation turns data into evidence. In public health it enables timely decisions, reveals inequities, and builds trust—when the graphics are designed to be understood. Make visuals useful by prioritising interpretability (plain-language titles, readable scales, clear denominators and uncertainty), reproducibility (scripted plots with code and data traceable via the **Source** link), and equity by default—routinely disaggregate and compare meaningful subgroups *(e.g., age, educational status, remoteness)* rather than relying on averages.\\\n**Visualisation is a public-health intervention: publish figures that are honest, interpretable, reproducible, and equity-aware.**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## **References**\n\n-   Tufte, E.
